beginning of a new era
Beginning of a New Era is a transcendental film experience delivering a strong and positive message of hope from the Mayan elders and other workers of light for these transformative times.

 

In the film Mayan elder Marzo Quetzal shares with us a message and a vision of a New Era,

which marks a new galactic cycle in time.

 

The film shines light on how there is a battle with the forces of good and evil within each one of us still that needs to be met in order to anchor the New Era on the Earth

– a battle that takes place inside each one of us - inside our very minds, acting through the unconscious spots of the mind.

Paradoxically, this darkness is revealing our light and true self.

 

Simultaneously, Beginning of a New Era tells the story of a journey that the Rainbow people took in 2012 - a group of earth warriors of peace and love.

 

That year they felt the calling and traveled to join the sacred ceremonies that marked the ending of the great 26 000 year cycle in the Mayan Calendar.

The Intention for the ceremonies was to align the high energies on behalf of world-peace.

 

The movie is an mixture of road journey and also gives a voice to numerous people that share us their views of current situation we are all experiencing, and explain how each of us are co-creating this new reality together.

 

The film looks on the situation humanity is currently going through from a spiritual perspective,

and reflects on what are the ways to transcend into a more peaceful, harmonious and loving world - inside and outside.

Like a saying goes

“We become awake by making the darkness conscious”

 

One of the film’s themes emphasized on the creative ability inside each one of us, reminding that we all have a role to play in the divine drama.

 

“We are indeed co-creators of our own reality, and not helpless victims.”

 

“How do we dream up our world?”
